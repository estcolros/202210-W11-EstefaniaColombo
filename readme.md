# Challenge week 11

## React & TypeScript form

Create with React a three-step form.

-   In each step there will be a group of fields, and only one step should be visible at a time.
-   Put in each step a button to navigate to the next and a button to navigate to the previous one (in the first step the previous button should not be visible).
-   In the third step there should be an "Access" button.
-   In each step, the button to continue to the next step should be disabled until all the fields of the step are filled in.

### Step 1: Personal data.

-   Name
-   Last name
-   BirthDate (when the user enters the date, the user's age in years should appear next to this field)
-   Gender (male/female/other/prefer not to mention) --> Radio button
-   Email address
-   Would you like to receive information from our newsletter? --> Checkbox

### Step 1: Access data.

-   Username
-   Password
-   Repeat password
-   Account type (personal/pro/business) --> It has to be a select

### Step 3: Confirmation.

-   The user should see all the data entered and confirm that it is correct. Button to confirm.

### Step 4: Login.

    - Username
    - Password

If the data is incorrect, an error message should be displayed.

If they are correct, you should be shown a screen with all the data entered in the form (it would be like a fourth step).
